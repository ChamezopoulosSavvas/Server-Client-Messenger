# Server-Client-Messenger

This is a simple project developed for the ECCE Auth course - Real Time Embedded Systems

It is a simple messaging service where the server runs indefinately (in this case in a flashed zsun device) and multiple clients may connect and leave and/or receive messages for/from other clients.
